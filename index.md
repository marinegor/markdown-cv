## Profile

Searching for a job that includes writing code / talking to people / running computations in approximately 60/20/20 proportion. Preferrably drug discovery / structural biology, because that is what I know well.

I have formal education in applied mathematics and physics, supplied with 1 year of full-time extracurricular education in computer science, and 7 years of computational lab experience.

I enjoy writing code, and want to write code that gets to run many times, and hence should be written wisely. And I can communicate with people.

### Software skills & activities

__Bag of words__: python, numpy, sklearn, scipy, pytorch, pytest, docker, ansible, bash, Ubuntu, HPC, SLURM.

üíæ administrated ~15 Linux workstations and servers with ~40 users, managind ~200 Tb of research data.

üòé participated in Google Summer of Code contributing to [MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/): introduced process-based parallelization to the library (see main [PR](https://github.com/marinegor/mdanalysis/tree/feature/dask-0)).

üßë‚Äçüíª contributed to opensource: [reciprocalspaceship](https://github.com/rs-station/reciprocalspaceship): wrote parser for serial crystallography data into binary dataframe-like class, [ntfy-cryosparc](https://github.com/marinegor/ntfy_cryosparc/): wrote web-server to parse CryoSPARC (tm) notifications and notify appropriate users.

üçù performed large-scale calculations on SLURM and PBS, wrote  bash scripts for reliable and reproducible data processing of serial crystallography data.

üèÜ participated in data science competitions (top-10% in Kaggle "Predict Molecular Properties", top-1 in first round of "Learning How To Smell", top-10% in Takeda Signate competition, 5th place in Tochka Bank graph ML competition).

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è self-hosted WebDAV, proxy & VPN servers, websites, wrote a python(pyo3)+Rust(pest) parser for crystallographic data.

### Science skills & acitivities

**Bag of words**: structural biology, crystallography, cryoEM, cheminformatics, computer vision, data science, molecular docking, drug discovery, protein structure, GPCRs, membrane proteins, structure-based drug discovery.

[üß¨+ü•©](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00674-1) **structural biology**: co-published papers in Science, Nature Communications, JACS, Science Advances, Journal of Chemical Information and Modelling, Scientific Data. Performed data analysis, wrote texts, created figures, managed writing process.

üíä **structure-based drug discovery**: performed large-scale virtual screening campaign, created robust accelerated virtual screening [approach](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01661), communicated with CROs, oversaw functional tests.
